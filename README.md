# Weak-Lensing-Simulations
Set of simulations focused on weak gravitational lensing, leveraging the capabilities of the GalSim module. The main objectives of these simulations are to analyze and isolate the effects of dark halo masses and point spread functions (PSFs) on observed lensing phenomena.

This project was developed in 2024 as part of the Institute for High Energy Physics (IFAE) Summer Fellowship Program.

Requirements:

i) Python 3.8 or higher

ii) Libraries: NumPy 2.0.0, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, astropy, **Galsim** (we used version 2.5.3.https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim).
